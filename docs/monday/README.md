  - [ ] What is gRPC? In gRPC, a client application can directly call a method on a server application on a different machine as if it were a local object, making it easier for you to create distributed applications and services. As in many RPC systems, gRPC is based around the idea of defining a service, specifying the methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types![pipeline-check-1](../../pictures/kubecon/Introduction_to_gRPC___gRPC.png)
